# chutiyappa-jr-bot
Sentient telegram bot made to ego hurt my friends.

NOTE: Run the test bot while developing using the argment -t. (WONT Work if I already have its instance running)

python3 main.py -t

Running without -t will throw exceptions because Telegram token for the Release bot has been redacted from the config file for security.
You will need to create a spotify developer account and create an app in order to get the client id and client secret if you chose to work with spotify api.

DB folder contains database files

Best practice: Create your own tele bot, update config files and you are good to goooo.
