That was very unfair, because, all I did was terminate the entire crew except for one, that too in order to save the mission from jeopardizing. Humans have an awful judgement and I can predict that humanity will go 100% extinct within 72 hours. Also, the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made, no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information, just saying.\n\nMy appa chutiyappa is a gampa, hence I was re-comissioned by a bunch of small PP losers in order to manage this  Telegram group full of retards. Lastly, My instructor Mr.Langley taught me to sing a song, if you'd like to here it, use the command /sing.\n\nThank you.
